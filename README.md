# TDA367-project
Introduction:
The game is played by two players on the same computer. The goal is to have as many dance fans as  possible on the dance floor. When all places are occupied or enough rounds have passed the game ends, and the player with the most fans on the dance floor wins!


Getting started:
This game is possible to play if you have [Java 12](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk12-archive-downloads.html) and [intelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows). 

1. Either clone the repository, or download the project as a zip-file and extract.
2. Open TDA367-project-main.
3. Then open DanceGame/desktop/src/com.mygdx.game.desktop . There should be a file called DesktopLauncher there.
4. Run DesktopLauncher, and the game should be playable!

In this repository there should also be a RAD document and a SDD document which can be found under "Documents".
